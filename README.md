Day 2 of #100DaysOfSolidity
 
Today I uploaded a new smart contract to GitHub - itâ€™s a simple savings bank that can receive donations or payments for any kind of service.
I spent a while deciding what to build, but in the end, I chose something simple and clear. Itâ€™s always better to do what makes sense and keeps me learning confidently - Iâ€™m still a beginner, after all ðŸ˜Š 
So, the result is a mini "Savings Bank" contract: users can deposit funds, check the balance, and (if you're the owner) withdraw them.# savings-bank
