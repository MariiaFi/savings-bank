# Day 2 of #100DaysOfSolidity
 
Today I uploaded a new smart contract to GitHub - itâ€™s a simple savings bank that can receive donations or payments for any kind of service.
I spent a while deciding what to build, but in the end, I chose something simple and clear. Itâ€™s always better to do what makes sense and keeps me learning confidently - Iâ€™m still a beginner, after all ðŸ˜Š 
So, the result is a mini "Savings Bank" contract: users can deposit funds, check the balance, and (if you're the owner) withdraw them.# savings-bank

## Day 3 of #100DaysOfSolidity

I paused to fully understand the logic behind my own smart contract.  
- Broke down my contract into logical blocks  
- Added inline comments and clarified each function  
- Created a visual infographic to explain how it works  
- Focused on strengthening foundational understanding before adding new features

###  Day 4 of #100DaysOfSolidity

I improved the existing smart contract instead of starting from scratch.  
- Added a new struct to **track each donor**  
- Implemented logic to store donor "address" and "amount" in an array  
- Now the contract owner can view the donation history  
- All written from scratch â€” no copy-paste, full understanding first!
